# Open Hiring Matrix (OHM)

## Introduction

The Open Hiring Matrix (OHM) is a framework designed to bring clarity, fairness, and consistency to the hiring process. By offering a structured view of the requirements for a role, including how important each skill is and providing an evaluation system, it enables companies to assess candidates across multiple skills, ensuring that the hiring decision is not based on subjective criteria or misconceptions between the candidate and the company.

OHM empowers both companies and candidates by making the selection process more transparent: candidates gain insight into the specific skills and requirements that matter most for the role, while companies benefit from a clear, quantifiable method to compare how much candidates align with the open role.

The matrix approach helps organizations prioritize what they value in a role—whether it’s technical expertise, soft skills, or cultural fit—while providing a balanced, holistic view of each candidate. In essence, OHM aligns expectations on both sides of the hiring equation, creating a fair and data-driven approach to talent acquisition.

Having a clear representation of what the company values most helps to align expectations and reduce bias. It ensures that the selected candidate is the best fit for the role overall, reducing uncertainty and preventing mistakes or assumptions during the interview process. This improves communication between companies and candidates and ultimately leads to better outcomes for both parties.

## Why

When reviewing job descriptions, it is often unclear what the company values most in a candidate when describing skills and requirements. For example, job descriptions might include terms like "Experience with...," "Strong knowledge of...," "Solid knowledge of...," "Advanced knowledge of...," or "Familiarity with..." without clarifying the level of proficiency required for each skill.

From a candidate’s perspective, it is challenging to understand the relative importance of each skill or how they align with the role. Not all skills will be equally important, and some may be highly required, while others are less so. OHM provides a structured and transparent way to share and evaluate candidates based on the skills and requirements that matter most for the role. It is a tool to help both companies and candidates align expectations and make more informed decisions.

As a candidate, understanding how much you align with the role, based on clear and objective criteria, can increase confidence when applying. This, in turn, improves the company’s chances of finding someone who is a great fit for the role.

## Purpose

OHM aims to provide:

- **Structure**: A framework for companies to describe the required skills (technical and non-technical) for a role.
- **Transparency**: Clear insight for candidates into how different skills and requirements are valued by the company.
- **Openness**: An evaluation template for companies to provide candidates with feedback.

## Implementation

To successfully implement the Open Hiring Matrix, companies should focus on these 3 areas:

- **Key skills**: Identify the most important skills for the role.
- **Criterion**: Describe specific criteria to evaluate each skill.
- **Weight**: Assign a weight to each criterion to reflect its importance in the role.

### Key Skills

It is paramount to identify the key skills required for the role. These skills should encompass both technical and soft
skills, as well as experience, cultural fit, and cultural contribution. or any other category that is relevant to the role according to the company's needs.

## Criterion

Each skill should be accompanied with a specific criteria on how the skill will be evaluated.
For example, if the skill is "Programming languages" the criterion could be "Proficiency in relevant programming languages".
The company could add more deail on how the proficiency will be evaluated, such as "Ability to write clean, efficient code in Python", or even have a checklist of questions or tasks that the candidate will be evaluated on.

## Weight

Assigning a weight to each skill is crucial to reflect its importance in the role. Not every skill is equally important,
and some may be more critical for the role than others. By assigning weights, companies can ensure that the evaluation
process is aligned with the role's requirements and priorities as well as the company's values and culture - or - other
attributes that are important to the company to include on their team.

## Example

Let's dive into an example of how the Open Hiring Matrix can be implemented for a software engineering role.

We will describe the different skills, criteria, and weights that could be considered for evaluating candidates for this role.

### Technical Skills

Technical skills involve evaluating the specific knowledge and competencies that enable a candidate to perform tasks or use tools in a particular field, such as programming, design, or systems management.

Now that we have defined the key skills, criteria, and weights for the role, we can use this matrix in the hiring process to evaluate candidates based on their skills, experience, and cultural fit.

### Example Evaluation Matrix

Once candidates are evaluated, the following columns will be added to the matrix:

- **Observations**: Specific notes or feedback on the candidate's performance in each criterion.
- **Score**: A numerical score between 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest possible score and 10 is the top score. It is assigned to each skill based on the candidate's performance based on the criterion.
- **Total Score**: The sum of all scores for each candidate. The the mathematical formula to describe this would be: Total Score = `∑(S × W)`

### Horizontal Evaluation Matrix

For simplicity, we are omitting the breakdown skills of each category. This matrix represents an aggregate view of each candidate's evaluation across major skill categories, with the final score reflecting the weighted sum for each candidate.

| Candidate   | Technical Skills (3) | Soft Skills (2) | Experience (3) | Cultural Fit (2) | Cultural Contribution (1) | Total Score |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Candidate A | 5 (15)               | 8 (16)          | 5 (15)         | 6 (12)           | 8 (8)                     | 66          |
| Candidate B | 7 (21)               | 7 (14)          | 7 (21)         | 7 (14)           | 6 (6)                     | 76          |
| Candidate C | 6 (18)               | 9 (18)          | 6 (18)         | 8 (16)           | 7 (8)                     | 78          |
| Candidate D | 8 (24)               | 6 (12)          | 6 (18)         | 7 (14)           | 6 (6)                     | 74          |

### Conclusion

In this example, **Candidate C** did not score the highest in **Technical Skills** (scoring 6), but they significantly outperform in **Soft Skills**, **Cultural Fit**, and **Cultural Contribution**. This balanced profile, with strong interpersonal and cultural strengths, makes **Candidate C** a more compelling fit for the company’s needs. Their total score of **78** reflects their well-rounded abilities, positioning them as a candidate who could integrate well with the team, even without being the strongest technically.

This scenario shows how modern hiring practices consider a variety of factors, such as communication, adaptability, and cultural alignment. It demonstrates that a candidate can still be a great fit for the team without necessarily excelling in one specific area, particularly when their strengths match what the company values most in its employees.

## Open Source

The OHM is an open-source project, and we encourage companies to adopt and adapt this framework to their specific needs. By using OHM, companies can:

## Web Application

We are planning to provide a web application that will allow companies to:

- Define matrices with skills and weights.
- Input candidate scores and observations, and calculate total scores.
- Share links to hiring matrices on job applications.
- Share evaluation results privately with candidates.

## Conclusion

The Open Hiring Matrix (OHM) provides a structured, transparent, and fair approach to the hiring process. By considering multiple skills and allowing for weighted evaluations, OHM helps companies make better hiring decisions and provides candidates with a clear understanding of what is valued by potential employers.
