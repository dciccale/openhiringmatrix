# Open Hiring Matrix (OHM)

[Versión en Español](/es)

## Introduction

In this document, we will explain what this project is about and how you can successfully implement it into your hiring process.

We aim to change the traditional approach to posting job offers. Moving away from lengthy and abstract lists of requirements, we are moving toward a more defined, accessible, and transparent hiring framework for both companies and candidates.

To achieve this, we have designed the **Open Hiring Matrix (OHM)**, a structured framework that brings clarity, fairness, and consistency to the selection process. This system not only provides a transparent view of the role requirements but also establishes the importance of each skill, allowing candidates to be assessed across a diverse set of competencies: technical, cultural, and interpersonal. The OHM ensures that hiring decisions are based on objective criteria, avoiding misunderstandings and subjective interpretations between candidates and companies.

Using the OHM, candidates gain a clear understanding of the most critical aspects of the role, while companies benefit from a quantifiable system to measure alignment between the candidate’s profile and the position. This approach helps organizations identify and prioritize the most valuable competencies—whether technical experience, interpersonal skills, or cultural fit—offering a balanced and comprehensive assessment of each candidate.

## Purpose 

Job descriptions often do not clarify which skills are truly prioritized by the company. Phrases like "Solid knowledge of...,” “Proficiency in...," "Experience with..." or "3 years of experience in..." tend to be vague and open to multiple interpretations, creating confusion for both candidates and companies. In many cases, the requirements listed and what is genuinely valued in the role do not fully align. For instance, does 'solid knowledge' imply more expertise than 'advanced knowledge'? Or does 'experience with' hold more value than 'strong knowledge'? In some cases, the distinctions seem more straightforward — for example, 'experience with' generally implies more than 'familiarity with,' right?

In the tech industry, requirement lists can seem endless, and we know that objective evaluation is not always feasible. Beyond technical skills, companies seek interpersonal abilities, global experience, and cultural fit. However, when these expectations are not clearly defined, the selection process can become inconsistent and discouraging.

On the one hand, long requirement lists may discourage candidates, making them uncertain about whether they meet expectations. On the other hand, companies risk missing out on valuable talent due to unclear or imprecise evaluations. This traditional approach does not effectively communicate what is truly essential for the role, potentially leading to misunderstandings that negatively impact both parties.
The purpose of OHM is to provide a comprehensive framework that facilitates the identification of required competencies while promoting transparency and openness in the selection process.

**We want to align job postings with how we evaluate candidates**.

Our goal is to simplify and enhance this process. We want candidates to clearly understand which competencies are most relevant for the role, and for companies to have objective tools to assess candidates fairly and consistently, based on concrete data rather than subjective interpretations.

OHM provides the structure needed to bridge gaps in understanding, ultimately creating more effective, transparent hiring practices.

## Foundations

In a constantly evolving job market, having a clear and equitable approach to hiring processes is essential. The Open Hiring Matrix (OHM) offers as a solution to address the challenges faced by both companies and candidates in their search for talent.

OHM aims to provide:

- **Structure**: A framework that allows companies to outline the specific technical and non-technical skills required for each role.
- **Transparency**: A clear perspective for candidates on how the company values various skills and requirements, helping them better understand what is expected.
- **Openness**: An evaluation model that encourages companies to give constructive feedback to candidates, promoting open communication throughout the hiring process.

## Components Evaluation

To conduct an effective assessment within the Open Hiring Matrix (OHM), we will focus on three key components: competence, criterion, and weight.

- **Competence**: This component helps us identify the essential skills and characteristics for the role. It includes not only technical skills but also interpersonal abilities and cultural factors that ensure a candidate fits well with the team. By clearly defining what we seek, we can better align our needs with what each candidate offers. For example, for a software developer, a fundamental competence could be "technical skills." This can be broken down into specific areas such as the programming language to evaluate, relevant frameworks and libraries, and practices related to testing and code quality.
- **Criterion**: This component sets specific standards for evaluating each skill, clarifying expectations. For example, if the skill is "Programming languages," the criterion could be “Proficiency in relevant programming languages,” with further detail like “Ability to write clean, efficient Python code.” This could be assessed with a checklist or tasks tailored to measure the candidate's expertise accurately.
- **Weight**: This component assigns relative importance to each competence. Not all competencies are equally critical, so by prioritizing the most relevant ones, we ensure our evaluation reflects what we truly need for the role. Each weight is distributed among the specified competences, indicating which aspects we value more.

Defining the components of competence, criterion, and weight creates a standardized assessment framework. This ensures evaluators have clear benchmarks and candidates understand the expectations. To illustrate this framework in action, let’s dive into an example of how the Open Hiring Matrix can be implemented for a software engineering role.

### TECHNICAL SKILLS

Technical skills involve evaluating the specific knowledge and competencies that enable a candidate to perform tasks or
use tools in a particular field, such as programming, design, or systems management.

These criteria measure how the candidate can enhance the company’s culture through diversity, innovation, and unique skills.

## Candidate Evaluation

Once the evaluation components are defined, we will proceed to assess the candidate based on each established criterion. The following columns will be utilized in the matrix:

- **Observations**: Specific notes or feedback on the candidate's performance in each criterion.
- **Score**: A numerical score between 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest possible score and 10 is the top score. It is
  assigned to each skill based on the candidate's performance based on the criterion.
- **Total Score**: The sum of all scores for each candidate. The mathematical formula to describe this would be: Total
  Score = `∑(S × W)`

By integrating scores and observations into the evaluation, we not only quantify performance but also provide constructive feedback. This dual approach highlights each candidate’s strengths and identifies areas for development, making the assessment process more comprehensive and transparent.

## Implementation

Now, let’s fully implement the Open Hiring Matrix using a software engineering role as our example.

#### **Final Score: 75.75**

The final score for this candidate would be the total sum of all the scores multiplied by their respective weights. In this case, the candidate scored **75.75** out of a possible 100.

### Horizontal Evaluation Matrix

For simplicity, we are omitting the breakdown skills of each category. This matrix represents an aggregate view of each candidate's evaluation across major competency criteria. As we assess **different candidates** in the selection process, the final score will reflect the weighted sum of their competencies, guiding us in the decision-making process to select the most suitable candidate.

| Candidate   | Technical Skills (3) | Soft Skills (2) | Experience (3) | Cultural Fit (2) | Cultural Contribution (1) | Total Score |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Candidate A | 5 (15)               | 8 (16)          | 5 (15)         | 6 (12)           | 8 (8)                     | 66          |
| Candidate B | 7 (21)               | 7 (14)          | 7 (21)         | 7 (14)           | 6 (6)                     | 76          |
| Candidate C | 6 (18)               | 9 (18)          | 6 (18)         | 8 (16)           | 7 (8)                     | 78          |
| Candidate D | 8 (24)               | 6 (12)          | 6 (18)         | 7 (14)           | 6 (6)                     | 74          |

### Conclusion

In this example, **Candidate C** did not score the highest in **Technical Skills** (scoring 6), but they significantly outperform in **Soft Skills**, **Cultural Fit**, and **Cultural Contribution**. This balanced profile, with strong
interpersonal and cultural strengths, makes **Candidate C** a more compelling fit for the company’s needs. Their total score of **78** reflects their well-rounded abilities, positioning them as a candidate who could integrate well with the
team, even without being the strongest technically.

This scenario shows how modern hiring practices consider a variety of factors, such as communication, adaptability, and cultural alignment. It demonstrates that a candidate can still be a great fit for the team without necessarily excelling
in one specific area, particularly when their strengths match what the company values most in its employees.
