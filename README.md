# Open Hiring Matrix (OHM)

[Versión en Español](/es)

## Introduction

In this document, we will explain what this project is about and how you can successfully implement it into your hiring process.

We aim to change the traditional approach to posting job offers. Moving away from lengthy and abstract lists of requirements, we are moving toward a more defined, accessible, and transparent hiring framework for both companies and candidates.

To achieve this, we have designed the **Open Hiring Matrix (OHM)**, a structured framework that brings clarity, fairness, and consistency to the selection process. This system not only provides a transparent view of the role requirements but also establishes the importance of each skill, allowing candidates to be assessed across a diverse set of competencies: technical, cultural, and interpersonal. The OHM ensures that hiring decisions are based on objective criteria, avoiding misunderstandings and subjective interpretations between candidates and companies.

Using the OHM, candidates gain a clear understanding of the most critical aspects of the role, while companies benefit from a quantifiable system to measure alignment between the candidate’s profile and the position. This approach helps organizations identify and prioritize the most valuable competencies—whether technical experience, interpersonal skills, or cultural fit—offering a balanced and comprehensive assessment of each candidate.

## Purpose 

Job descriptions often do not clarify which skills are truly prioritized by the company. Phrases like "Solid knowledge of...,” “Proficiency in...," "Experience with..." or "3 years of experience in..." tend to be vague and open to multiple interpretations, creating confusion for both candidates and companies. In many cases, the requirements listed and what is genuinely valued in the role do not fully align.

In the tech industry, requirement lists can seem endless, and we know that objective evaluation is not always feasible. Beyond technical skills, companies seek interpersonal abilities, global experience, and cultural fit. However, when these expectations are not clearly defined, the selection process can become inconsistent and discouraging.

On the one hand, long requirement lists may discourage candidates, making them uncertain about whether they meet expectations. On the other hand, companies risk missing out on valuable talent due to unclear or imprecise evaluations. This traditional approach does not effectively communicate what is truly essential for the role, potentially leading to misunderstandings that negatively impact both parties.
The purpose of OHM is to provide a comprehensive framework that facilitates the identification of required competencies while promoting transparency and openness in the selection process.

**We want to align job postings with how we evaluate candidates**.

Our goal is to simplify and enhance this process. We want candidates to clearly understand which competencies are most relevant for the role, and for companies to have objective tools to assess candidates fairly and consistently, based on concrete data rather than subjective interpretations.


## Foundations
In a constantly evolving job market, having a clear and equitable approach to hiring processes is essential. The Open Hiring Matrix (OHM) offers as a solution to address the challenges faced by both companies and candidates in their search for talent.

OHM aims to provide:

- **Structure**: A framework that allows companies to outline the specific technical and non-technical skills required for each role.
- **Transparency**: A clear perspective for candidates on how the company values various skills and requirements, helping them better understand what is expected. 
- **Openness**: An evaluation model that encourages companies to give constructive feedback to candidates, promoting open communication throughout the hiring process. 

## Implementation

To successfully implement the Open Hiring Matrix, companies should focus on these 3 areas:

- **Skills**: Identify the key dimensions that the role requires, such as technical abilities or interpersonal
  capabilities.
- **Criterion**: Each skill is measured by specific indicators that assess the candidate's proficiency and alignment
  with the role.
- **Weight**: Assign a weight to each criterion to reflect its importance in the role.

### Skills

It is paramount to identify the key skills required for the role. These skills should encompass both technical and soft
skills, as well as experience, cultural fit, and cultural contribution, or any other category that is relevant to the
role according to the company's needs.

### Criterion

Each skill should be accompanied by a specific criterion on how the skill will be evaluated. For example, if the skill
is "Programming languages," the criterion could be "Proficiency in relevant programming languages." The company could
add more detail on how proficiency will be evaluated, such as "Ability to write clean, efficient code in Python," or
even have a checklist of questions or tasks that the candidate will be evaluated on.

### Weight

Assigning a weight to each skill is crucial to reflect its importance in the role. Not every skill is equally important,
and some may be more critical for the role than others. By assigning weights, companies can ensure that the evaluation
process is aligned with the role's requirements and priorities as well as the company's values and culture—or other
attributes that are important to the company to include on their team.

## Example

Let's dive into an example of how the Open Hiring Matrix can be implemented for a software engineering role.

We will describe the different skills, criteria, and weights that could be considered for evaluating candidates for this
role.

Now that we have defined the key skills, criteria, and weights for the role, we can use this matrix in the hiring
process to evaluate candidates based on their skills, experience, and cultural fit.

## Evaluation

Once candidates are evaluated, the following columns will be added to the matrix:

- **Observations**: Specific notes or feedback on the candidate's performance in each criterion.
- **Score**: A numerical score between 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest possible score and 10 is the top score. It is
  assigned to each skill based on the candidate's performance based on the criterion.
- **Total Score**: The sum of all scores for each candidate. The mathematical formula to describe this would be: Total
  Score = `∑(S × W)`

### Final Score: **75.75**

The final score for this candidate would be the total sum of all the scores multiplied by their respective weights. In
this case, the candidate scored **75.75** out of a possible 100.

### Horizontal Evaluation Matrix

For simplicity, we are omitting the breakdown skills of each category. This matrix represents an aggregate view of each
candidate's evaluation across major skill categories, with the final score reflecting the weighted sum for each
candidate.

| Candidate   | Technical Skills (3) | Soft Skills (2) | Experience (3) | Cultural Fit (2) | Cultural Contribution (1) | Total Score |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Candidate A | 5 (15)               | 8 (16)          | 5 (15)         | 6 (12)           | 8 (8)                     | 66          |
| Candidate B | 7 (21)               | 7 (14)          | 7 (21)         | 7 (14)           | 6 (6)                     | 76          |
| Candidate C | 6 (18)               | 9 (18)          | 6 (18)         | 8 (16)           | 7 (8)                     | 78          |
| Candidate D | 8 (24)               | 6 (12)          | 6 (18)         | 7 (14)           | 6 (6)                     | 74          |

### Conclusion

In this example, **Candidate C** did not score the highest in **Technical Skills** (scoring 6), but they significantly
outperform in **Soft Skills**, **Cultural Fit**, and **Cultural Contribution**. This balanced profile, with strong
interpersonal and cultural strengths, makes **Candidate C** a more compelling fit for the company’s needs. Their total
score of **78** reflects their well-rounded abilities, positioning them as a candidate who could integrate well with the
team, even without being the strongest technically.

This scenario shows how modern hiring practices consider a variety of factors, such as communication, adaptability, and
cultural alignment. It demonstrates that a candidate can still be a great fit for the team without necessarily excelling
in one specific area, particularly when their strengths match what the company values most in its employees.
